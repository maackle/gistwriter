# GistWriter

Display a blog, backed by GitHub Gists.

This is for an interview challenge, so it's not a serious app, but I'm making this public anyway, hence this disclaimer...

Live version at [https://maackle.github.io/gistwriter/]

## Configuration

1. Set `username` in App.js to your github username.
2. Any public gists you create including a file named `post.md` will be displayed as a blog post.

## Running

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To run the development server, use `yarn start`.
